multigrid
=========

Repo for geometric (and later) algebraic multigrid methods for solving partial differential equations.

The multigrid methods provided are a series of Fortran modules for solving elliptic partial differential equations in two and three space dimensions. This was code I completed for my research as a graduate student. I will be providing updates to code and documentation when I have time.
