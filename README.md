multigrid
=========

Repo for geometric (and later) algebraic multigrid methods for solving partial differential equations.

The multigrid methods provided are a series of Fortran modules for solving elliptic partial differential equations in two and three space dimensions. This is based on code I completed for my research as a graduate student, but written in a more recent iteration of Fortran.
